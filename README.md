# Game of Life

Garrett Reiter

The Game of Life program uses the rules of Jon Conway's "Game of Life" to manipulate
a randomly generated 5x5 LED matrix over 100ms frames.

I made a simple state machine to detect and delay input from button B, which inverts the
LEDS from on to off and vice versa.

The A button randomized which LEDs are turned on.
